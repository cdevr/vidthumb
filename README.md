Use mplayer and python imaging library to create 3x3 thumbnail images of videos. It is parallellized for maximum speed. 

This python library can be useful for a few other things, for example it contains a method get_thumbnail(video, timeindex), which gets you back a PIL image of a frame of the video as close as possible to timeindex.

I should probably make it more customizable, but it does what I want it to do at this point.
